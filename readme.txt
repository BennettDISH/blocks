# Custom Web Components

## Project Structure

- /components
  - text-block.js
  - video-block.js
  - swap-block.js
- index.html
- main.js

## How to Use

1. Serve the project files using a web server (e.g., http-server).

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the components in action.

3. You can also import and use these components in another project by including `main.js` as a module.
